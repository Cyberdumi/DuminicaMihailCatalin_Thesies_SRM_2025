# Supplier Relationship Manager (SRM)

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a modern and efficient Supplier Relationship Management (SRM) system. Starting with core functionalities, we plan to iteratively develop it into a comprehensive platform for managing supplier interactions, tracking performance, and optimizing procurement processes.

## Core Technologies

The application is built using the following technologies:

*   **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
*   **Database:** MySQL
*   **ORM:** Sequelize
*   **Frontend:** React

## Vision & Future Features

Our goal is to create an innovative SRM that goes beyond basic contact management. Future versions will introduce advanced features designed to provide deep insights and streamline procurement workflows:

1.  **Historical Offer Tracking:**
    *   Implement a system to record and store supplier offers over time, creating a valuable historical dataset for each supplier and product/service.
    *   This allows for trend analysis and better negotiation leverage based on past pricing and terms.

2.  **Offer Analytics & Visualization:**
    *   Develop dynamic dashboards and graphs based on the historical offer data.
    *   Visualize price fluctuations, offer frequencies, and comparison between suppliers to enable data-driven decision-making.

3.  **Integrated Bidding Module:**
    *   Introduce a feature allowing users to initiate and manage bidding processes directly within the SRM.
    *   Suppliers could potentially interact with the system (in later phases) to submit bids, streamlining the Request for Quotation (RFQ) process.

## Getting Started
